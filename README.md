# Movie Finder
Movie Finder app. Part 1
Pleae add theMovieDb API key at line 38, in MainActivityFragment.java file.
Waiting eagerly for your feedback. 

#P.S. 
There are some minor issues with Instance State saving on returning back from DetailActivity to MainActivity. Also, it was hard getting some tutorial/example on using dropdown as actionView in Appbar. Somehow found it. Even more confusing thing is to access Fragment's methods and variables in Activity and Vice-verca. e.g. I tried converting functions to static, but more errors start to pop out(like Zombies, literally!).  Finally had to add a method onCreateOptionsMenu(). 

Also the GridView is pretty bad, for images of different sizes. On the UI side, wanted to implement main image poster scrolling in sync with CollapsingToolbarLayout looking like fb/twitter profile pic over the cover pic. But it seemed tough. Got preety background images(accidently!). Well, Iguess that's preety much it. A great learning experirnce!
